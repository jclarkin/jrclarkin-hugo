   I was invited to offer a workshop on authoring Test Automation, using the following tools:
   <ul>
    <li>Selenium WebDriver</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JUnit</li>
    <li>Eclipse</li>
   </ul>

   We covered the basics of coding in Java and creating simple scripts, to more advanced topics such as architecting your code via page objects and advanced selectors.
